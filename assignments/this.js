/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. In the global scope, the this keyword refers to the windows object and it houses all variables and functions defined in the global scope
* 2. When a function is called using the dot notation (e.g obj.test()), the this keyword in that function will refer to the object before the dot notation
* 3. Every time an instance of a class is created, the constructor runs and the this keyword inside that constructor refers to that instance of that class at that time 
* 4. When calling a method using javascripts call() or apply() method, the this keyword is explicitly defined as first arguement.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
